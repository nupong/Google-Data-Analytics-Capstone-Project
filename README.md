### Dataset
Cyclistic's historical trip data has been used for analyse and identify trends. Noted that the datasets have a different name becuase Cyclistic is a fictional company.
The data has been moade available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

### Background
Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet about 6,000 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 600+ stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

#### Phase1: Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclsitic bike differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

**Business Task**
Primary stakeholders: The director of marketing and Cyclistic executive team
Secondary stakeholders: Cyclistic marketing analytics team

Stakeholder would like to convert casual riders into annual mmembers as conclusion that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.

Problem: Maximizing annual memberships
Insights: Understanding how annual members and casual ridres use the bikes differenyly, identifying factors that motivate casual ridersto become members
Business Decisions: Developing targeted marketing strategies to encoruage casual riders to become members, offering incentives or diccounts to encourage casual riders to upgrade to annual memberships, adjusting pricing plans to make annual memberships more attractive.

The analysis would entail identifying the differences and similarities in usage patterns, such as the durations of rides, the frequency of rides, the distance traveled and the time of day when the bikes are used.
